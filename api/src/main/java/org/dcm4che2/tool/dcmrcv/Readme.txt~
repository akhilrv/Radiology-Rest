This the dcmrcv package from the dcm4che2 toolkit.
# It is not being used by the module in anyway and it was part of the old module.
# It is used to create a dicom compliant storage server to receive images.
# Since dcm4chee is used as the PACS to store images. This package is redundant.
# It's been left here for anyone to use in the future.
